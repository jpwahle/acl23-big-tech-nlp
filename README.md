This repository contains the code and data for the paper [The Elephant in the Room: Analyzing the Presence of Big Tech in Natural Language Processing Research](arxiv.org/abs/2305.02797).

## Data
If you want to use our preprocessed data, consider `data/processed_data.zip`.

To reproduce the data for later years, you will need to download the `anthology.bib` from the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org) and place it in the `data` folder.

You can find the list of universities [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings) and an export of big tech companies [here](https://finviz.com).

To reproduce the dataset, you can use the notebook `notebooks/datasets.ipynb`.

### Analysis
For running parts of the analysis of the paper, you can use the notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`.
